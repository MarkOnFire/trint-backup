# Exporting files from Trint
**Trint has three different file formats (Transcript, Caption and Story)**
**Transcript** : A Trint Transcript file contains timed words broken by speaker. This is great for highlighting and finding important points within an audio or video file.
**Caption** : A Trint Caption file contains timed caption blocks. Caption blocks control what text is displayed and how long it is on screen. This is great for creating closed captions.
**Story** : A Trint Story file contains free text, titles and quotes from Transcript files. The quotes can be played back in sequence. This is great for creating a rough cut or for collecting lots of important quotes together as part of some wider research.
Each file type in Trint can be exported in different ways. Expand the file type to see what is possible.
