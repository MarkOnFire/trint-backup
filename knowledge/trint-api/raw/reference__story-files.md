# Trint Story
**Trint has three different file formats (Transcript, Caption and Story)**
A **Trint Story** file contains free text, titles and quotes from Transcript files. The quotes can be played back in sequence. This is great for creating a rough cut or for collecting lots of important quotes together as part of some wider research.
